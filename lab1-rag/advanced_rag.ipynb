Subject to Section 4.3, DIALOG will pay ENERGOUS the Service Fees set forth in Exhibit B. For clarity, subject to Section\\n4.3, DIALOG will be responsible for paying to ENERGOUS any Service Fees payable hereunder for services provided by ENERGOUS hereunder to\\nDIALOG’s Affiliates or any of DIALOG’s or its Affiliates’ customers.\\n \\n9.3 Payment. Payments of Royalties and Service Fees will be due on a calendar quarterly basis, within [***] days after the end of the\\ncalendar quarter in which the applicable Licensed Products were Sold or services were rendered. From the date a payment is due, unless otherwise\\nagreed, any late payment will accrue a late payment fee of [***] per month, or the highest interest rate permitted by law, whichever is less.\\n \\n9.4 Reports. Each payment made hereunder will be accompanied by a report detailing (a) the total number of units, on a product-by-\\nproduct basis, of the Licensed Products Sold during the previous calendar quarter, (b) DIALOG’s and its Affiliates’ Net Sales attributable to such\\nLicensed Product units during such calendar quarter, and (c) reasonable details regarding the calculation of the quarterly Royalty payment and\\nService Fee. Such information will be maintained in strict confidence by ENERGOUS under Section 10 of this Agreement.\\n \\n9.5 Books. With respect to its exercise of the rights and licenses granted in, and payment obligations under, this Agreement, DIALOG and\\nits Affiliates will keep accurate books and other records, including but not limited to supporting documentation for the Royalties and Service Fees\\npaid hereunder (the “Records”). These Records will be maintained for a period of at least three (3) years from the date of the related payment\\n(“Record Retention Period”), notwithstanding any termination of expiration of this Agreement.\\n \\n9.6 Audit Rights. During the Record Retention Period, ENERGOUS may appoint a mutually agreed independent, internationally recognized\\nthird-party certified auditor who will have the right to inspect and copy the Records upon reasonable prior notice, and DIALOG will (and will cause\\nits Affiliates to) allow necessary access including, as applicable, to its premises where such Records are located. ENERGOUS may exercise such\\nright to this independent-third party audit no more than one time per calendar year and each such audit will be conducted during normal business\\nhours. Such audit may also not interfere with DIALOG’s or its Affliates’ quarterly closing of its books. In the event that such audit reveals an\\nunderpayment of Royalties or Service Fees owed by DIALOG, DIALOG will promptly pay ENERGOUS the amount of the underpayment. If such\\nunderpayment is in excess of [***] of the Royalties or Service Fee due for the period audited, DIALOG will also reimburse ENERGOUS for its\\nreasonable, out-of-pocket cost of such audit. In the event that such audit reveals an overpayment of Royalties or Service Fees owed by DIALOG,\\nENERGOUS will promptly pay DIALOG the amount of the overpayment.\\n \\n* Confidential Treatment Requested\\n \\nPage 12\\n \\n \\n \\n9.7 Taxes. Each party will be responsible to collect, bear and pay any and all taxes levied or based upon the party’s sale of the Products,\\nProduct Die or Licensed Products, including, all sales, use, value added, withholding or similar taxes. In the event that the government of a country\\nimposes any income taxes on payments made by a party to the other hereunder and requires a party to withhold such tax from such payments, such\\nparty may deduct such tax from such payments. Each party will be responsible for its own banking costs relating to the receipt of payments of\\nRoyalties and Service Fees and any other monies payable to it in connection with this Agreement.\\n \\n9.8 Payment Currency. All payments due under this Agreement will be payable in U.S. Dollars. With respect to Net Sales invoiced in a\\ncurrency other than U.S. Dollars, the Net Sales will be expressed in the domestic currency of the entity making the Sale, together with the U.S.\\nDollar equivalent, calculated using the conversion rate existing in the United States (as reported in the Wall Street Journal) on the last working day\\nof each month of the calendar quarter in which the Net Sales were made. Such payments will be without deduction of exchange, collection or other\\ncharges.\\n \\n10. CONFIDENTIALITY.\\n \\n10.1 Scope. The term “Confidential Information” means all financial, business and technical information disclosed by or on behalf of a\\nparty in relation to this Agreement (whether tangible or intangible, and including all copies, analyses and derivatives thereof), that is marked or\\notherwise identified as proprietary or confidential at the time of disclosure, or which by its nature would be understood by a reasonable person to\\nbe proprietary or confidential, including all copies, abstracts, summaries, analyses and derivatives thereof. Confidential Information does not\\ninclude information the receiving party can demonstrate (a) was rightfully furnished to it without restriction by a third party without breach of any\\nobligation to the disclosing party, (b) is generally available to the public without breach of this Agreement, (c) was available to or already in the\\npossession or control of the receiving party on a non-confidential basis before receipt from the disclosing party or (d) is independently developed\\nby it or its employees without reliance on such information. Information associated with DIALOG’s quarterly Royalty or Service Fee disclosures is\\nConfidential Information of DIALOG.\\n \\n10.2 Non-Disclosure. The receiving party agrees (a) not to copy or use the disclosing party’s Confidential Information except and only for\\nthe purposes contemplated by this Agreement, (b) to maintain it as confidential, and exercise reasonable precautions to prevent unauthorized\\naccess, use and disclosure, (c) not to disclose it to any third party other than the receiving party’s employees and contractors who have a need to\\nknow for the permitted purpose and who are bound by obligations that are at least as protective as the restrictions in this Agreement and (d) not to\\nexport or re-export in violation of U.S. or other export control laws or regulations any such Confidential Information or product thereof. Each party\\nwill bear the responsibility for any breach of this Section 10 by its and its Affiliates’ employees and contractors. Upon any termination of this\\nAgreement or, in the event of any Wind Down Period or Continuing Obligation period, upon the expiration of such period, and within fifteen (15)\\ndays after request by the disclosing party, each receiving party will return the Confidential Information of the other or destroy such Confidential\\nInformation and all copies of it and all information, records and materials developed therefrom, except that the recipient may retain one copy for\\narchival purposes to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, and nothing contained herein will require the erasure, deletion,\\nalteration or destruction of any Confidential Information required to be retained for legal or regulatory purposes or stored on back-up tapes or other\\nback-up media or archiving systems made in the ordinary course of business, subject in each case to the confidentiality obligations set forth herein.\\nEach party may only disclose the general nature, but not the specific terms, of this Agreement without the prior consent of the other party;\\nprovided, however, either party may provide a copy of this Agreement or otherwise disclose its terms on a confidential basis in connection with\\nany legal or regulatory requirement, financing transaction or due diligence inquiry. For clarity, in the event that use, disclosure or retention of any\\nConfidential Information is required in order for DIALOG to exercise the license granted in Section 2, this Section 10 will not be deemed to prevent\\nsuch use, disclosure or retention.\\n \\n \\nPage 13\\n \\n \\n \\n10.3 Required Disclosure. Nothing herein will prevent a receiving party from disclosing all or part of the other’s Confidential Information as\\nnecessary pursuant to court order, the lawful requirement of a governmental agency or when disclosure is required by operation of law (including\\ndisclosures pursuant to applicable securities laws or regulations thereunder); provided, that prior to any such disclosure, the receiving party will\\nuse reasonable efforts to (a) promptly notify the disclosing party in writing of such requirement to disclose, and (b) cooperate fully with the\\ndisclosing party in protecting against or minimizing any such disclosure or obtaining a protective order.\\n \\n11.

The above warranties are valid for a period of [***] from the date of shipment of any Licensed Product to\\nany customer.\\n \\n(b) The warranty contained in Section 11.2(a) does not apply to the extent any Product is operated in a manner other than that\\nspecified by the Product Specifications, is treated with abuse, negligence or other improper treatment (including, without limitation, use outside the\\ndevice maximum ratings, package MSL (moisture sensitivity level) guidelines or environmental limits as may be set forth in the Product\\nSpecifications), or is defective as a result of any materials or workmanship of the Manufacturing Subcontractors or failure of the Manufacturing\\nSubcontractors to manufacture the Product according to Approved Production Specifications. As such, any warranty claims due to defects in\\nbuild, materials or workmanship will be directed to the Manufacturing Subcontractors as part of that contract between DIALOG or, if applicable, its\\nAffiliate and such parties.\\n \\n(c) With the exception of the warranties in Section 11.2(a)(ii) (third party IP infringement) and Section 11.2(a)(iii) (misappropriation\\nof third party trade secrets) related to any Product Die, the warranties in this Section 11.2 do not apply to MCMs or repackaged Product Die\\ndeveloped by or for DIALOG or its Affiliates.\\n \\n(d) In the event any warranty claim is due to or arises from an Epidemic Defect, ENERGOUS will be responsible for all costs and\\nexpenses directly incurred by DIALOG or its Affiliates or their respective customers as a result of reasonable inspection, servicing, repairs,\\nreplacements, recall notices, recalls and responses with respect thereto, provided that ENERGOUS’ aggregate liability to DIALOG and its Affiliates\\nand their respective customers under this paragraph (d) will not exceed [***] per occurrence of an Epidemic Defect. Each party will immediately\\nnotify the other upon becoming aware of the circumstance that could reasonably be construed to be an indication of an Epidemic Defect, and, in\\nany event, will notify the other party immediately upon becoming aware of the existence of an Epidemic Defect. ENERGOUS and DIALOG will\\nexpeditiously work together in good faith to determine a technical resolution of the Epidemic Failure. ENERGOUS agrees to make all commercially\\nreasonable efforts to promptly diagnose the Epidemic Failure’s root cause, provide DIALOG a report detailing the results of ENERGOUS’\\ninvestigation and plan an effective workaround and a permanent solution. ENERGOUS will consult with DIALOG on any proposed workarounds\\nand other solutions.\\n \\n* Confidential Treatment Requested\\n \\nPage 15\\n \\n \\n \\n11.3 Infringement of Intellectual Property Rights. If any of the Products, Product Die, Documentation or Deposit Materials is, or in\\nENERGOUS’ or DIALOG’s opinion is likely to become, the subject of an Intellectual Property Rights infringement claim, and as a result DIALOG or\\nany of its Affiliates or their respective customers are enjoined, or in ENERGOUS’ or DIALOG’s opinion are likely to be enjoined, from using the\\nProducts, Product Die, Documentation or Deposit Materials, ENERGOUS will use its best efforts to:\\n \\n(a) procure for DIALOG and its Affiliates and their respective customers the right to continue to use the Products, Product Die,\\nDocumentation or Deposit Materials, as applicable; or, but only in the event that, despite ENERGOUS’ best efforts to do so, ENERGOUS is unable\\nto so procure such right,\\n \\n(b) replace or modify the Products, Product Die, Documentation or Deposit Materials, as applicable, to make them non-infringing,\\nprovided that the replaced or modified Products, Product Die, Documentation and Deposit Materials remain substantially similar in performance to\\nthe infringing Products, Product Die, Documentation and Deposit Materials.\\n \\nIf none of the foregoing alternatives is available within a commercially reasonable time period, DIALOG may terminate this Agreement with\\nimmediate effect, provided that it will give ENERGOUS prompt prior written notice thereof. Nothing in this Section 11.3 is intended to limit\\nDIALOG’s rights to indemnification under Section 12 in connection with any such infringement claim.\\n \\n11.4  Disclaimer. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 11, THE PRODUCTS, THE PRODUCT IP, TOOLING,\\nDOCUMENTATION, DEPOSIT MATERIALS, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND ALL LICENSES, SERVICES AND OTHER ITEMS PROVIDED\\nBY A PARTY TO THE OTHER PARTY HEREUNDER ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

INDEMNIFICATION.\\n \\n12.1 Indemnification by Energous. Subject to Section 12.2, ENERGOUS agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and, in the case of any third\\nparty claims, defend DIALOG and its Affiliates and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, contractors, agents, distributors and\\ncustomers (collectively, “DIALOG Indemnitees”) from and against and in respect of any and all alleged or actual demands, claims, actions, causes\\nof action, suits or proceedings, assessments, awarded damages (including punitive damages), liabilities, interest and penalties, costs and expenses\\n(including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable legal fees and disbursements in connection therewith) (each, a “Claim”) to the extent\\nresulting from, arising out of, relating to, or imposed upon or incurred by any DIALOG Indemnitees by reason of (a) death or bodily injury caused\\nby or resulting from use of the Products, (b) any breach of any representation or warranty made by ENERGOUS hereunder or to any third party in\\nrelation to the Products or Product Die, (c) the infringement or misappropriation of any third party Intellectual Property Rights in relation to the\\nProducts or Product Die, (d) the infringement or misappropriation of any third party Intellectual Property Rights as a result of DIALOG’s or its\\nAffiliates’ exercise of rights in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the Manufacturing Subcontractors’\\nmanufacture of the Products on their behalf, provided that the Products are manufactured in strict compliance with the Product Specifications and\\nApproved Production Specifications and only to the extent such Claims arise due to compliance with the Product Specifications and/or the\\nApproved Production Specifications or use of the Tooling provided by ENERGOUS hereunder, (e) the infringement by DIALOG of any third party\\nMarks rights as a result of its authorized use of the ENERGOUS Marks, (f) any failure by ENERGOUS to comply with applicable laws, regulations\\nand standards, or (g) ENERGOUS’ negligence, intentional misconduct or fraud.\\n \\n \\nPage 16\\n \\n \\n \\n12.2 Exclusion. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12.1, ENERGOUS will not be liable to the extent any Claim results from (a)\\nmodification of the Products by DIALOG, its Affiliates and/or any third party (including the Manufacturing Subcontractors), or combination of the\\nProducts with other products, offered by DIALOG, its Affiliates and/or any third party, (b) acts or omissions of any Manufacturing Subcontractor\\n(except to the extent such Claims are due to the infringement or misappropriation of third party Intellectual Property Rights arising from such\\nManufacturing Subcontractor’s manufacturing of the Products on behalf of DIALOG in strict compliance with the Product Specifications,\\nApproved Production Specifications and Tooling provided by ENERGOUS), (c) failure of any DIALOG Indemnitee to comply with applicable laws,\\nregulations and standards, or (d) negligence, intentional misconduct or fraud of any DIALOG Indemnitee.

DIALOG will cooperate and provide assistance and information as may\\nreasonably be required by ENERGOUS (but at ENERGOUS’ expense) in connection therewith. DIALOG reserves the right to participate at its own\\ncost in any third party proceedings with counsel of its own choosing. In the event that ENERGOUS does not respond to any third party Claim or\\ndoes not sufficiently defend such third party Claim, DIALOG, acting reasonably, may step in and take over the defense of such Claim. Costs\\nincurred in the settlement of any Claim, including, but not limited to, reasonable legal expenses, may be off set against future Royalties and Service\\nFees payable.\\n \\n \\nPage 17\\n \\n \\n \\n12.4 Insurance.

The licenses granted pursuant to this Agreement are license to rights in “intellectual property” (as that term is\\ndefined in Section 101 of the United States Bankruptcy Code) and governed by 11 USC Section 365(n). Accordingly, if a trustee in bankruptcy\\nrejects the Escrow Agreement and/or this Agreement as executory contracts, then Company may elect to retain its rights under this Agreement in\\naccordance with and subject to the provisions of 11 USC Section 365(n).\\n \\n \\nPage 21\\n \\n \\n \\n17.

    "Purpose: Improve the retrieval accuracy by breaking down documents into smaller, more focused chunks (typically sentences).\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation: Documents are split into sentences, and each sentence is embedded separately. During the retrieval phase, queries are matched against these sentence-level embeddings, and then retrieve the surrounding sentences (similar idea as sliding window) to maintain the context cohesiveness.\n",

Specifically, Section 20.10 states that \"This Agreement may not be assigned by either party without the express written consent of the other party, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except that either party may (without consent but with notice to the other party) assign this Agreement in its entirety to any successor in the event of a Change of Control of such party.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n------------------------\\nSub-Question: Is the assignment of the contract to a third party a novation or a mere assignment?\\nAnswer: \\nBased on the contract, the assignment of the contract to a third party is a mere assignment.

The documents do not indicate any transfer of ownership, merger, or acquisition that would result in Dialog Semiconductor becoming a successor in interest to Energous Corporation. Instead, the documents suggest a strategic alliance and licensing agreement between Energous Corporation and Dialog Semiconductor, where Dialog Semiconductor is authorized to use Energous Corporation\\'s Mask Set(s) for manufacturing products for supply to Dialog Semiconductor. Therefore, Dialog Semiconductor is not a successor in interest to Energous Corporation.\\n\\n\\n\\n------------------------\\nSub-Question: Is the assignment of the contract to a third party a novation or a mere assignment?\\nAnswer: \\nBased on the contract, the assignment of the contract to a third party is a mere assignment.

According to this section, ENERGOUS may appoint a mutually agreed independent, internationally recognized third-party certified auditor who will have the right to inspect and copy the Records upon reasonable prior notice, and DIALOG will (and will cause its Affiliates to) allow necessary access including, as applicable, to its premises where such Records are located.

According to Section 9.6, ENERGOUS may exercise its right to an independent-third party audit no more than one time per calendar year, and each such audit will be conducted during normal business hours. Additionally, the audit may not interfere with DIALOG's or its Affiliates' quarterly closing of its books. This restriction limits the frequency and timing of the audit. \\n         \\n------------------------\\nSub-Question: Are there any implied rights to audit based on the contract's terms and conditions?\\nAnswer: \\nYes, there is an implied right to audit based on the contract's terms and conditions. Specifically, Section 9.8 states that ENERGOUS may exercise its right to an independent-third party audit no more than one time per calendar year and each such audit will be conducted during normal business hours.

For example, in the context of the agreement, ENERGOUS may exercise its right to audit DIALOG's records to ensure compliance with the agreement and to verify the accuracy of the royalties and service fees paid. This is in line with industry standards and regulatory requirements that require companies to maintain accurate records and allow for audits to ensure compliance. Additionally, the agreement itself grants ENERGOUS the right to audit DIALOG's records, which implies a right to audit.
