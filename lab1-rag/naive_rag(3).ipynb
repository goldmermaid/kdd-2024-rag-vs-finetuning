As such, any warranty claims due to defects in\\nbuild, materials or workmanship will be directed to the Manufacturing Subcontractors as part of that contract between DIALOG or, if applicable, its\\nAffiliate and such parties.\\n \\n(c) With the exception of the warranties in Section 11.2(a)(ii) (third party IP infringement) and Section 11.2(a)(iii) (misappropriation\\nof third party trade secrets) related to any Product Die, the warranties in this Section 11.2 do not apply to MCMs or repackaged Product Die\\ndeveloped by or for DIALOG or its Affiliates.\\n \\n(d) In the event any warranty claim is due to or arises from an Epidemic Defect, ENERGOUS will be responsible for all costs and\\nexpenses directly incurred by DIALOG or its Affiliates or their respective customers as a result of reasonable inspection, servicing, repairs,\\nreplacements, recall notices, recalls and responses with respect thereto, provided that ENERGOUS’ aggregate liability to DIALOG and its Affiliates\\nand their respective customers under this paragraph (d) will not exceed [***] per occurrence of an Epidemic Defect.

ENERGOUS and DIALOG will\\nexpeditiously work together in good faith to determine a technical resolution of the Epidemic Failure. ENERGOUS agrees to make all commercially\\nreasonable efforts to promptly diagnose the Epidemic Failure’s root cause, provide DIALOG a report detailing the results of ENERGOUS’\\ninvestigation and plan an effective workaround and a permanent solution. ENERGOUS will consult with DIALOG on any proposed workarounds\\nand other solutions.\\n \\n* Confidential Treatment Requested\\n \\nPage 15\\n \\n \\n \\n11.3 Infringement of Intellectual Property Rights.

DIALOG will cooperate and provide assistance and information as may\\nreasonably be required by ENERGOUS (but at ENERGOUS’ expense) in connection therewith. DIALOG reserves the right to participate at its own\\ncost in any third party proceedings with counsel of its own choosing. In the event that ENERGOUS does not respond to any third party Claim or\\ndoes not sufficiently defend such third party Claim, DIALOG, acting reasonably, may step in and take over the defense of such Claim. Costs\\nincurred in the settlement of any Claim, including, but not limited to, reasonable legal expenses, may be off set against future Royalties and Service\\nFees payable.\\n \\n \\nPage 17\\n \\n \\n \\n12.4 Insurance.
