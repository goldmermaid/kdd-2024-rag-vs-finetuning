Answer =  The Joint IP Ownership clause in the contract BONTONSTORESINC_04_20_2018-EX-99.3-AGENCY AGREEMENT states that the parties agree to jointly own and share the intellectual property rights (IP) created during the term of the agreement. This means that both parties will have equal rights to use, modify, and distribute the IP, and any profits generated from the IP will be shared equally between the parties. The clause also specifies that the parties will work together to maintain and defend the IP, and that any disputes arising from the IP will be resolved through arbitration. \n",
