4.3 Technical Support. ENERGOUS will support DIALOG’s or its Affiliates’ engineers and, in some cases and at DIALOG’s request, the
customer directly in providing standard design-in support (including antenna design support) for customers’ products. If the customer requires
unique or custom engineering services (i.e., support and services not limited to those with general application to Product customers), then
ENERGOUS will contract directly with such customer for the provision of such services. ENERGOUS will provide DIALOG with any and all
information that is necessary or useful to support its authorized manufacture, testing, marketing, Sale, troubleshooting, compatibility analysis,
performance tuning, failure analysis, and other support of the Licensed Products, including the 
------------------------
 with written notice
that it does not wish to negotiate with respect to such New Product. For clarity, after any of the events described in the foregoing subsections (a),
(b) or (c) occurs, the New Product will not be covered under this Agreement, and ENERGOUS will be free to manufacture, market, sell, distribute and
otherwise exploit such New Product as it deems fit in its sole discretion, including in collaboration with or through one or more third parties.
 
8.2 No Competing Products.
 
(a) Until expiration or earlier termination of the Agreement, DIALOG agrees that it and its Affiliates will not, without ENERGOUS’
written approval, intentionally sell, distribute or work with any third party to develop products incorporating any Uncoupled Power Transfer
Technology other than Licensed Products; provided, however, that DIALOG shall not be under any such restrictions in relation to services or
products it provides to the Key Customer in the event the Key Customer terminates its agreement with ENERGOUS.
 
(b) 
------------------------
wever, either party may provide a copy of this Agreement or otherwise disclose its terms on a confidential basis in connection with
any legal or regulatory requirement, financing transaction or due diligence inquiry. For clarity, in the event that use, disclosure or retention of any
Confidential Information is required in order for DIALOG to exercise the license granted in Section 2, this Section 10 will not be deemed to prevent
such use, disclosure or retention.

10.3 Required Disclosure. Nothing herein will prevent a receiving party from disclosing all or part of the other’s Confidential Information as
necessary pursuant to court order, the lawful requirement of a governmental agency or when disclosure is required by operation of law (including
disclosures pursuant to applicable securities laws or regulations thereunder); provided, that prior to any such disclosure, the receiving party will
use reasonable efforts to (a) promptly notify the disclosing party in writing of such requirement to

However, ENERGOUS is allowed to engage with a Semiconductor Supplier to supply comparable products or product die to a customer if either (i)
the customer which has not been engaged with DIALOG with respect to such product or product die notifies ENERGOUS or DIALOG in writing by
an authorized officer of the customer that it does not want to use DIALOG or a DIALOG Affiliate as a supplier of such product or product die; or (ii)
if DIALOG has been engaged with the customer, the customer notifies ENERGOUS or DIALOG in writing prior to commencement of the Design-In
Phase that it does not want to use DIALOG or a DIALOG Affiliate as a supplier of such product or product die. For clarity, ENERGOUS shall not
intentionally supply Products, Product Die or comparable products or product die to customers directly or through distribution channels.
 
2.6 Branding.
 
(a) Products Sold by DIALOG or its Affiliates may be branded as DIALOG products. All
------------------------
will not be liable to the extent any Claim results from (a)
modification of the Products by DIALOG, its Affiliates and/or any third party (including the Manufacturing Subcontractors), or combination of the
Products with other products, offered by DIALOG, its Affiliates and/or any third party, (b) acts or omissions of any Manufacturing Subcontractor
(except to the extent such Claims are due to the infringement or misappropriation of third party Intellectual Property Rights arising from such
Manufacturing Subcontractor’s manufacturing of the Products on behalf of DIALOG in strict compliance with the Product Specifications,
Approved Production Specifications and Tooling provided by ENERGOUS), (c) failure of any DIALOG Indemnitee to comply with applicable laws,
regulations and standards, or (d) negligence, intentional misconduct or fraud of any DIALOG Indemnitee. For clarification, if any of the foregoing is
not the cause, in whole or in part of the Claim, ENERGOUS is not relieved of its obligations under Section
------------------------
parties’ respective rights and obligations under Sections 2 (License), 3 (Sourcing), 7 (Product Sales), 9 (Royalties and
Service Fees), 11 (Representations and Warranties; Disclaimers), 12 (Indemnification), 13 (Limitation of Liability), 14 (Compliance with Laws), 15.2
(Termination), 16 (Escrow) and all Exhibits hereto which are associated with any of the foregoing listed sections will remain in full force and effect as

to or within one (1) month after the start of the Wind Down Period, or (B) the sale of any MCMs which have been released for production at a
foundry, provided, however, that DIALOG’s license rights under Section 2.1 (including any sublicenses granted by DIALOG pursuant to Section
2.4) will be non-exclusive during the Wind Down Period.
 
(b) If, at the time of notice of any termination of this Agreement, DIALOG or any of its Affiliates has a written su

the manufacture and supply of Licensed Products under terms and conditions that DIALOG or such Affiliates may directly negotiate with such
third parties.
 
3.2 Additional Manufacturing Subcontractors. DIALOG at its sole discretion may qualify and establish an alternative source to some or all
of ENERGOUS’ Manufacturing Subcontractors for the manufacturing of the Licensed Products and ENERGOUS will provide its written
authorization thereof if requested by DIALOG.
 
3.3  Tooling. Subject to ENERGOUS’ rights in the Product IP and any Third Party IP (including, without limitation, that of any
Manufacturing Subcontractors), each party will own all right, title and interest in the physical Tooling procured or generated by that party for the
manufacturing, testing and packaging of the Licensed Products. For the avoidance of doubt, as between the parties, ENERGOUS will

notice, for a period of [***] following ENERGOUS’ receipt of such notice, ENERGOUS and DIALOG will negotiate in good faith the terms pursuant
to which such New Product will be added as a Product to this Agreement. ENERGOUS may not negotiate with any third party the rights to market,
sell or distribute any New Product until the earliest to occur of the following (a) DIALOG does not provide ENERGOUS with notice that it desires to
add such New Product to this Agreement within the above-described [***] period, (b) ENERGOUS and DIALOG do not reach mutually agreeable
terms for adding such New Product to this Agreement during the [***] negotiation period or (c) DIALOG provides ENERGOUS with written notice

(b) or (c) occurs, the New Product will not be covered under this Agreement, and ENER

ENERGOUS in this Agreement, and all such other rights are hereby reserved.
 
6.2 DIALOG Intellectual Property. DIALOG retains rights, title and interest in and to DIALOG’s Marks and DIALOG’s Confidential
Information, including all Intellectual Property Rights embodied therein. No transfer or grant is made hereunder by DIALOG of any of these rights
or any of its other rights, whether by implication, estoppel or otherwise, other than the limited rights and licenses expressly granted by DIALOG in
this Agreement and all such other rights are hereby reserved.
 
7. PRODUCT SALES.
 
7.1 Sales. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and except as set forth in the Commercialization Plan or otherwise agreed
in writing between the parties, DIALOG will market and Sell the Licensed Products as authorized under this Agreement. DIALOG will independently
