Sub-Question: What is the definition of Non-Compete?
Answer:  >
The definition of Non-Compete is not explicitly stated in the provided documents.

Sub-Question: If yes, does the termination clause specify a notice period and a waiting period?
Answer:  >
Yes, the termination clause specifies a notice period and a waiting period. For example, in Section 15.2, it states that either party may terminate this Agreement upon not less than [***] prior written notice to the other party. Additionally, in Section 15.4, it states that if DIALOG or its Affiliate has a written supply contract with a customer that extends beyond the end of the Wind Down Period, DIALOG and/or its Affiliates may continue to Sell Licensed Products to such customer through the term of the Wind Down Period and for the remainder of the term of such Continuing Obl
------------------------
Sub-Question: If yes, does the notice period and waiting period align with the requirements of the applicable law?
Answer:  >
The notice period and waiting period in the agreement seem to align with the requirements of the applicable law. For instance, the notice period for termination is 180 days, which is a reasonable period of time for a party to consider its options before terminating the agreement. Similarly, the waiting period for the wind-down period is [***] days, which is a reasonable period of time for the parties to complete any outstanding obligations before the agreement terminates. However, it would be beneficial to review the specific laws and regulations applicable to the parties to ensure that the notice period and waiting period comply with all relevant requirements. 
------------------------
Sub-Question: If yes, can the party terminate the contract without cause by giving the required notice and allowing the waiting period to expire?
Answer:  >
Yes, according to Section 15.2 (iii) of the contract, ENERGOUS may terminate the Agreement without cause by giving written notice to DIALOG and allowing the waiting period to expire. The waiting period is not specified in the contract, but it is mentioned that ENERGOUS may terminate the Agreement upon not less than [***] prior written notice to DIALOG. This implies that ENERGOUS has the right to terminate the Agreement without cause by providing the required notice and allowing the waiting period to expire. Similarly, DIALOG may also terminate the Agreement without cause by giving written

Sub-Question: Is the assignment of the contract to a third party a novation or a mere assignment?
Answer:  >
The assignment of the contract to a third party is a novation. Novation is a type of contract modification that involves the substitution of a new party for an existing party, resulting in the creation of a new contract. In this case, the assignment of the contract to a third party would result in the creation of a new contract between the third party and the other contracting parties, effectively replacing the original contracting party.

In contrast, a mere assignment would involve the transfer of the original contracting party's rights and obligations to a third party, without creating a new contract. In this case, the original contracting party

Sub-Question: Is the assignment of the contract to a third party a novation or a mere assignment?
Answer:  >
The assignment of the contract to a third party is a novation. Novation is a type of contract modification where the original parties to the contract are replaced by new parties, and the new parties assume the rights and obligations of the original parties. In this case, the assignment of the contract to a third party is a novation because the original parties (Dialog Semiconductor and Energous Corporation) are replaced by new parties, and the new parties (the third party) assume the rights and obligations of the original parties.

A mere assignment, on the other hand, is a transfer of the contract rights and obligations

Sub-Question: Does the contract explicitly state that intellectual property created by one party becomes the property of the counterparty?
Answer:  >
Yes, the contract explicitly states that intellectual property created by one party becomes the property of the counterparty. Specifically, Section 6 (Intellectual Property Ownership) states that ""Each party will own all right, title and interest in the intellectual property created by that party in connection with this Agreement."" This suggests that any intellectual property created by one party, such as ENERGOUS, becomes the property of that party, and similarly for DIALOG. However, it's worth noting that the contract also mentions ""Product IP"" which is defined as ""Intellectual Property Rights licensed from a third party relating to

Sub-Question: Does the contract contain any provisions that could be interpreted as transferring ownership of intellectual property to the counterparty?
Answer:  >
Yes, the contract contains several provisions that could be interpreted as transferring ownership of intellectual property to the counterparty. For example, Section 2.1 grants ENERGOUS a non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, sub-licensable, royalty-bearing license to DIALOG to repackage or have repackaged the Product Die into various package formats or layouts, and to integrate the Product Die into MCMs. This provision could be interpreted as transferring ownership of the intellectual property embodied in the Product Die to ENERGOUS.

Additionally, Section 6.2 states that DIALOG

Sub-Question: Are there any specific events or circumstances that could trigger the transfer of ownership of intellectual property to the counterparty?
Answer:  >
Yes, there are specific events or circumstances that could trigger the transfer of ownership of intellectual property to the counterparty. According to Section 1.28, upon the termination of DIALOG's right to manufacture the Licensed Products following any expiration or termination of the Agreement or any Wind Down Period or Continuing Obligation period, as applicable, then all right, title and interest in the Tooling will automatically transfer to ENERGOUS subject to any Third Party IP, and DIALOG will, at ENERGOUS' option, either sell any Tooling in its possession to ENERGOUS at cost or

Sub-Question: Can the intellectual property be used by the counterparty without the need for permission or license from the party that created it?
Answer:  >
The answer is no. According to Section 2.1 of the agreement, ENERGOUS hereby grants to DIALOG a non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, sub-licensable (solely in accordance with Section 2.4), royalty-bearing license during the Term under all Product IP to repackage or have repackaged the Product Die into various package formats or layouts, and to integrate the Product Die into MCMs, which may incorporate DIALOG or third party intellectual property (such repackaged Product Die, MCMs and Products, are individually and/or collectively

<question>
Is there a requirement for insurance that must be maintained by one party for the benefit of the counterparty?
</question>
<answer>
","Each party will maintain, during the Term and for three (3) years thereafter, such comprehensive general liability insurance (including without limitation, products liability) as will adequately protect it against its potential liabilities under this Agreement, in amounts customary in the semiconductor industry for similar services and products., Each party will, at the other party's request, provide to the other party a certificate of insurance evidencing the foregoing insurance coverage.","Yes, according to Section 12.4 of the agreement, each party must maintain insurance during the term and for three years after the term ends. This requirement is mandatory, and the parties are not given the option to opt out of it. The agreement does not specify any particular insurance provider or policy that must be used, but rather leaves it up to the parties to choose their own insurance providers and policies as long as they comply with the requirements of the agreement. The purpose of this requirement is likely to ensure that the parties are protected against certain risks or losses, and to provide a level of financial security for the counterparty.
