The answer should be `SELECT '2023-01-01' + INTERVAL 7 YEAR AS contract_end_date;` because the contract's initial term is 7 years and it starts on `2023-01-01`. The contract's initial term will expire on `2030-01-01`.

<groud_truth>
Sub-Question: Does the contract contain a termination clause that allows for termination without cause?
Answer: 
Yes, the contract contains a termination clause that allows for termination without cause. Specifically, Section 20.3(iii) states that ENERGOUS may terminate this Agreement with or without cause upon not less than one hundred and eighty (180) days prior written notice to DIALOG. This provision allows for termination without cause, as it does not require a specific reason or breach of contract. 














<s
------------------------
Sub-Question: If yes, does the termination clause specify a notice period and a waiting period?
Answer: 
Yes, the termination clause specifies a notice period and a waiting period. According to Section 15.2(a), if a party materially breaches a material provision of this Agreement, it must give written notice to the other party and cure the breach within thirty (30) days. If the breach is not cured, the Agreement can be terminated. Additionally, Section 15.4(a) specifies a Wind Down Period of [***] from the Effective Date or [***] following the effective date of termination or expiration of this Agreement. This indicates that there is a waiting period before the termination takes effect. 
</s
------------------------
Sub-Question: If yes, does the notice period and waiting period align with the requirements of the applicable law?
Answer: 
The notice period and waiting period mentioned in the agreement are 20 days and 30 days, respectively. The applicable law is not explicitly mentioned in the agreement. However, it is generally recommended that the notice period and waiting period align with the requirements of the applicable law to ensure compliance and avoid any potential legal issues.

In the absence of specific guidance from the applicable law, it is difficult to determine whether the notice period and waiting period align with the requirements of the applicable law. Therefore, it is recommended that the parties consult with legal experts to ensure compliance with the applicable law and to determine whether the notice period and waiting period align
------------------------
Sub-Question: If yes, can the party terminate the contract without cause by giving the required notice and allowing the waiting period to expire?
Answer: 
Yes, the party can terminate the contract without cause by giving the required notice and allowing the waiting period to expire. For example, ENERGOUS can terminate the contract under Section 20.2(b)(iii) by giving DIALOG written notice and allowing the 180-day waiting period to expire. Similarly, DIALOG can terminate the contract under Section 20.2(c)(ii)(A) by giving ENERGOUS written notice and allowing the waiting period to expire. In both cases, the termination is without cause and is subject to the notice and waiting period requirements.

Sub-Question: Does the contract contain a provision that addresses assignment of the contract?
Answer: 
Yes, the contract contains a provision that addresses assignment of the contract. Specifically, Section 20.10 states that ""This Agreement may not be assigned by either party without the express written consent of the other party, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except that either party may (without consent but with notice to the other party) assign this Agreement in its entirety to any successor in the event of a Change of Control of such party.""











------------------------
Sub-Question: Is the assignment of the contract to a third party a novation or a mere assignment?
Answer: 
Based on the contract, the assignment of the contract to a third party is a mere assignment. According to Section 20.10, ""This Agreement may not be assigned by either party without the express written consent of the other party, which approval will not be unreasonously withheld or delayed, except that either party may (without consent but with notice to the other party) assign this Agreement in its entirety to any successor in the event of a Change of Control of such party."" This suggests that the assignment is a mere assignment, as the parties are not intending to create a new contract, but rather to transfer the existing contract
------------------------
Sub-Question: Is the third party a successor in interest to the original party?
Answer: 
Based on the provided documents, it appears that the third party, Dialog Semiconductor, is not a successor in interest to the original party, Energous Corporation. The documents do not indicate any transfer of ownership, merger, or acquisition that would result in Dialog Semiconductor becoming a successor in interest to Energous Corporation. Instead, the documents suggest a strategic alliance and licensing agreement between Energous Corporation and Dialog Semiconductor, where Dialog Semiconductor is authorized to use Energous Corporation's Mask Set(s) for manufacturing products for supply to Dialog Semiconductor. Therefore, Dialog Semiconductor is not a successor in interest to Energous Corporation.

Answer: 
No, the contract does not explicitly state that intellectual property created by one party becomes the property of the counterparty. According to section 1.10, ""Invention"" means any idea, concept, discovery, invention, development, technology, work of authorship, trade secret, software, firmware, library, component, tool, mask work, process, method, technique, know-how, show-how, data, plan, formula, device, apparatus, specification, design, documentation or other material or information, tangible or intangible, whether or not it may be patented, copyrighted or otherwise protected.

Answer: 
Based on the contract's language, there are no implied rights to audit explicitly stated. However, industry standards may imply certain rights to audit, such as the right to inspect and verify the accuracy of records and reports. For example, Section 12 (Indemnification) mentions that the parties will indemnify each other against any claims, damages, or expenses arising from the unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information. This could imply a right to audit or inspect the other party's records to verify compliance with the agreement.

Sub-Question: Does the requirement for insurance apply to a specific type of risk or asset?
Answer: 
Based on the provided documents, the requirement for insurance in Section 12.4 applies to ""comprehensive general liability insurance (including without limitation, products liability) as will adequately protect it against its potential liabilities under this Agreement, in amounts customary in the semiconductor industry for similar services and products."" This suggests that the requirement for insurance applies to a specific type of risk, which is liability risk, and not to a specific type of asset. The insurance coverage is intended to protect against potential liabilities under the agreement, rather than against damage to a specific asset.
